Hi there! I'm Ahmed I Sankoh, a software engineering student. I'm passionate about building software, and I'm eager to learn and grow as a developer.

On this GitHub profile, you'll find a collection of my personal projects. After my course I will be writting blogs where I will be sharing my thoughts on software engineering and related topics.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn. If you're hiring, or if you have any interesting projects you'd like me to contribute to, please feel free to contact me!
